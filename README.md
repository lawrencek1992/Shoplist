# Shoplist

#### Built by: Kelly Lawrence
_If you like this work, I am seeking a front end/UI developer position. Please email me at lawrencek1992@gmail.com if you'd like to work together._

### Installation

Clone the repository and use **node package manager** to install. 

```bash
https://github.com/lawrencek1992/Shoplist.git
npm install
```

### Usage

I used **Google Firebase** for user authentication, cloud storage, and firestore. You will need to set up your own project in firebase, and you will need to create your own **firebase.js** file with **your own firebase configuration information**.

### Built With:

* React (with hooks)
* Bootstrap
* Google Firebase
* React Transition Group
* Pexels Stock Photos
* Font Awesome Icons
